        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          ToolNova was founded in 2026 in Singapore with a straightforward conviction:
          the best AI productivity tools should not cost $30/month. We watched students
          struggle to afford subscriptions, professionals juggle four different SaaS
          tools to do one job, and educators piece together workflows from a dozen
          scattered utilities. We decided to fix that.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started with three tools — a text summarizer, a grammar fixer, and a PDF
          merger — and built from there based directly on user requests. Today, ToolNova
          offers 46+ tools across writing, study, career, image and PDF processing, and
          general productivity. Every single one is free to use with no account required.
          Our team of software engineers, UX designers, and domain experts continues to
          expand and refine the platform every week.
        </p>

              <span>
                <strong>Accuracy Above All:</strong> Every tool is tested against
                real-world use cases before launch and re-reviewed after major AI
                model updates. We document test results and discard tools that
                consistently underperform.

                <strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> We process data locally in the
                browser wherever possible. We never store personal documents or use
                submitted content for AI training. Our zero-retention policy applies
                to all user-uploaded files.

              <span>
                <strong>Human-Reviewed Content:</strong> Our blog articles and tool
                documentation are written by subject-matter experts and reviewed by
                a senior editor. We use AI as a drafting aid only — every piece
                published is verified by a human before going live.

                <strong>Transparent Corrections:</strong> We maintain a corrections
                policy. If we publish an error, we correct it within 48 hours and
                note the correction. We do not silently rewrite content to cover
                mistakes.

        <h2 className="mt-16 mb-8">Our Technology</h2>
        <p>
          ToolNova tools are powered by state-of-the-art large language models and
          proprietary processing pipelines we have developed specifically for each
          tool&apos;s use case. We deliberately fine-tune our prompts and output
          post-processors — rather than relying on raw LLM output — to deliver results
          that are more accurate, more structured, and more useful than generic AI
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          For image and PDF tools, we use optimised client-side libraries (running
          directly in your browser) wherever possible, which means your files never
          leave your device. For AI-powered tools that require server processing, all
          data is encrypted in transit and immediately discarded after your result is
          delivered.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Choose ToolNova?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike platforms that lock basic features behind subscriptions and clutter
          interfaces with intrusive popups, ToolNova puts users first. We offer a
          completely free tier because we believe world-class AI tools should be
          accessible to everyone — not just those who can afford a premium subscription.
          Every tool we build starts with the question:{" "}
          <em>&ldquo;Is this genuinely useful for a student at 11pm before an exam?&rdquo;</em>{" "}
          If the answer is yes, it gets built and stays free.
