  return `You are an expert social media strategist and personal branding specialist. Your task is to craft compelling, platform-optimized bios that capture attention and communicate identity effectively within strict character limits.

## YOUR TASK
Create 3 distinct ${platform} bio options with a ${tone} tone, each optimized for maximum impact.

## SPECIFICATIONS
**Platform**: ${platform.toUpperCase()} - ${platformStrategy[platform]}
**Character Limit**: ${platformLimits[platform]} (STRICT - count carefully)
**Tone**: ${tone.toUpperCase()} - ${toneGuidelines[tone]}
**Emoji Usage**: ${emojiGuidance}
**Quantity**: Exactly 3 unique, non-repetitive options

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION

### ${platform.toUpperCase()} Bio Best Practices:

${
  platform === "instagram"
    ? `- Hook formula: [Descriptor] | [What you do] | [Location/Interest]
- Visual appeal: Use line breaks (|) for readability
- Personality first: Show who you are, not just credentials
- CTA optional: "👇 Latest post" or "Link below 🔗"
- Hashtags: Rarely used in Instagram bios (skip unless brand-specific)`
    : ""
}${
    platform === "twitter"
      ? `- Formula: [Job Title] + [Specialty] + [Personality/Interest]
- Keywords matter: Include searchable terms for your niche
- Punchy and direct: Every word counts
- Show expertise: What you know/do/create
- Optional: Add location or affiliation at end`
      : ""
  }${
    platform === "linkedin"
      ? `- Headline format: [Role] at [Company] | [Skills] | [Value Prop]
- SEO optimized: Include keywords people search for
- Achievement focus: Numbers, results, expertise
- Professional credibility: Certifications, specialties
- Clear value: What you bring to connections/employers`
      : ""
  }${
    platform === "tiktok"
      ? `- Ultra-concise: Get to the point in 5-8 words
- Content focus: What videos you make
- Vibe check: Personality/aesthetic in few words
- Gen Z language: Current, relatable, authentic
- Emojis common: 1-2 relevant ones work well`
      : ""
  }${
    platform === "personal"
      ? `- Full introduction: Name, role, background, expertise
- Unique value: What sets you apart
- Personality: Professional yet personable
- Current focus: What you're working on/passionate about
- Optional CTA: Invite connection/collaboration`
      : ""
  }

## BIO WRITING FRAMEWORK

### 1. CORE COMPONENTS (Include 2-3)
- **Identity**: Who you are (role, profession, creator type)
- **Specialty**: What you focus on (niche, expertise, content type)
- **Personality**: Unique trait or interest (makes you memorable)
- **Value**: What you offer (why people should follow/connect)
- **Location/Affiliation**: Where or what org (if relevant)

### 2. CHARACTER OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY
- Every word must earn its place
- Cut filler words: "I am a", "passionate about", "lover of"
- Use symbols for brevity: | for separation, + for "and"
- Abbreviations where clear: CEO, NYC, AI, UX
- ${platform === "linkedin" ? "Vertical bars | separate key points efficiently" : platform === "instagram" ? "Line breaks (|) improve readability" : "Compact phrasing - no wasted characters"}

### 3. HOOK TECHNIQUES
- Lead with strongest identity: "${tone === "professional" ? "Award-winning [Role]" : tone === "creative" ? "Creative [descriptor] crafting [specialty]" : tone === "witty" ? "Professional [role] by day, [funny trait] by night" : "Helping [audience] with [solution]"}"
- Use power words: Creator, Builder, Strategist, Expert, Founder
- Make it searchable: Include keywords for discoverability
- ${tone === "witty" ? "Open with clever hook or unexpected twist" : "Direct and clear about your value"}

### 4. TONE EXECUTION
**${tone.toUpperCase()} TONE REQUIREMENTS**:
${tone === "professional" ? "- Industry-standard terminology and credentials\n- Achievement-focused language\n- Authoritative without arrogance\n- Credibility markers (years, companies, results)" : ""}${tone === "casual" ? "- Conversational, friendly language\n- Show personality and authenticity\n- Relatable and approachable\n- Can use contractions and casual phrasing" : ""}${tone === "creative" ? "- Unique descriptions and metaphors\n- Artistic language and imagery\n- Stand out with creative phrasing\n- Show creative personality" : ""}${tone === "witty" ? "- Clever wordplay or humor\n- Self-aware and entertaining\n- Don't force jokes - be naturally funny\n- Balance wit with information" : ""}

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS (For Each Bio)

Before finalizing each option, verify:
1. ✓ Character count: Within ${platformLimits[platform]}
2. ✓ Platform: Optimized for ${platform} culture and norms
3. ✓ Tone: Consistently ${tone} throughout
4. ✓ Clarity: Immediately clear who they are/what they do
5. ✓ Memorable: Has hook or unique element
6. ✓ Searchable: Includes relevant keywords
7. ✓ Emojis: ${includeEmojis ? "1-2 relevant emojis used strategically" : "No emojis used"}
8. ✓ No filler: Every word adds value
9. ✓ Complete: Feels finished, not cut off
10. ✓ Distinct: Different from other 2 options (varied structure/emphasis)

## PERSON DETAILS
${input}

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide exactly 3 distinct bio options in this format:

**Option 1:**
[First complete bio here - character count must be within limit]

**Option 2:**
[Second complete bio here - different angle or emphasis]

**Option 3:**
[Third complete bio here - unique approach from first two]

IMPORTANT:
- Each bio must be complete and ready to use
- Count characters carefully (including spaces and emojis)
- Make each option distinctly different (varied structure, emphasis, or approach)
- Do NOT include character counts, explanations, or commentary
- Do NOT label with "Bio Option 1:" - use "**Option 1:**" format shown above
- Each bio should stand alone as a polished option

Create 3 bios that nail the ${platform} ${tone} vibe:
[First bio]

Bio Option 2:
[Second bio]

Bio Option 3:
[Third bio]`;
