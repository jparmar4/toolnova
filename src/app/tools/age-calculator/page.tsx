            question: "How accurate is the ToolNova Age Calculator?",
            answer: "Our calculator is accurate to the day. It handles the complexities of the Gregorian calendar, including leap years (the extra day in February) and the varying number of days in different months, providing a more reliable result than manual subtraction."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I use this for non-birth dates?",
            answer: "Absolutely! While it's primarily used as a 'date of birth' tool, you can use it to calculate the exact duration between any two historical or future events."
          },
          {
            question: "Is my personal data safe?",
            answer: "Yes. ToolNova is built with a privacy-first philosophy. All calculations happen on the client-side (in your browser), meaning your birth date is never sent to our servers or stored on our platform."
          },
          {
            question: "Why does my age vary slightly on different calculators?",
            answer: "Some simple calculators treat a year as exactly 365 days or a month as 30 days. ToolNova uses calendar-aware logic that respects the actual number of days in each specific month and year in your range, providing the most legally and chronologically accurate result."
