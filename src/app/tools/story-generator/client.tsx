- Create questions in reader's mind

### 2. CHARACTER INTRODUCTION & SETTING

- ${audience === "children" ? "Make characters relatable and likeable" : audience === "teens" ? "Create authentic, complex teen characters" : "Develop psychologically realistic, flawed characters"}
- Set up character's goal or desire

### 3. RISING ACTION & CONFLICT

### 4. CLIMAX (Story Peak)

### 5. RESOLUTION & ENDING

- Show how characters have changed/grown
- Tie up loose ends (unless intentional cliffhanger)
- ${audience === "children" ? "Provide clear, positive conclusion with lesson" : audience === "teens" ? "Hopeful or meaningful ending" : "Can be ambiguous, bittersweet, or thought-provoking"}

### Engaging Prose
- Vary sentence length (mix short punchy sentences with flowing longer ones)
- Use strong, specific verbs (sprinted, whispered, shattered vs. went, said, broke)
- Include vivid imagery and metaphors
- ${audience === "children" ? "Simple but descriptive language" : audience === "teens" ? "Contemporary, energetic style" : "Literary, sophisticated prose"}

### Dialogue (if included)
- Make it natural and character-specific
- Use dialogue to advance plot or reveal character
- Balance with action and description
- ${audience === "adults" ? "Can be subtle, layered with subtext" : "Clear and purposeful"}

### Pacing
