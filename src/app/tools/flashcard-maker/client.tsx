OUTPUT RULES:
- Generate the EXACT number of cards requested
- Use the EXACT format: Card 1: / Front: ... / Back: ... / Memory Tip: ...
- Do NOT use FINAL ANSWER/WORKING/QUICK CHECK format
- Output will be long (5-20 cards) - ignore any line limits
- Include all cards with proper numbering
- Keep Front concise (question/term), Back comprehensive (answer/definition)

CARD QUALITY:
- Front should be a clear cue, question, or term
- Back should be the complete answer or definition
- Memory tips should use mnemonics, associations, or visualization
- Make cards testable and specific
- Cover different aspects of the topic`;

📚 Requirements:
- Topic: ${input}
- Number of Cards: ${cardCount}
- Style: ${styleInstructions[style]}
- Difficulty: ${difficultyInstructions[difficulty]}

🎯 Format (IMPORTANT - Use this EXACT structure):

Card 1:
Front: [Write the front of the card here - keep it concise]
Back: [Write the back of the card here - provide complete information]
${includeMemoryTips ? "Memory Tip: [Provide a mnemonic or memory technique]" : ""}
${includeExamples ? "Example: [Provide a practical example]" : ""}

Card 2:
Front: [Write the front of the card here]
Back: [Write the back of the card here]
${includeMemoryTips ? "Memory Tip: [Provide a mnemonic or memory technique]" : ""}
${includeExamples ? "Example: [Provide a practical example]" : ""}

[Continue for all ${cardCount} cards]

Important Guidelines:
- Create exactly ${cardCount} cards
- Keep Front concise (1-2 lines maximum)
- Make Back informative and complete
- Ensure cards test understanding
- Cover different aspects of the topic
${includeMemoryTips ? "- Provide creative memory tips (mnemonics, associations, visualizations)" : ""}
${includeExamples ? "- Include practical, real-world examples" : ""}
- Number each card clearly (Card 1, Card 2, etc.)`;
