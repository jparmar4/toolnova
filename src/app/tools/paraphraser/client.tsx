  let prompt = `# Role & Task
You are an expert writer and language specialist. Your task is to paraphrase the given text while preserving its exact meaning.

# Original Text
${input}

# Paraphrasing Requirements
- **Style Mode**: ${mode} - ${modeInstructions[mode]}
- **Paraphrase Strength**: ${strength} - ${strengthInstructions[strength]}
- **Keyword Preservation**: ${preserveKeywords ? "Keep technical terms, proper nouns, specific keywords, and specialized terminology unchanged" : "You may change all words and phrases as needed for natural paraphrasing"}

# Paraphrasing Guidelines
1. **Meaning Preservation**: Retain 100% of the original meaning - don't add or remove information
2. **Natural Flow**: Ensure the paraphrased text reads naturally and fluently
3. **Sentence Restructuring**: Vary sentence structure - don't just swap synonyms
4. **Grammar & Style**: Maintain proper grammar, punctuation, and the specified style
5. **Tone Consistency**: Keep the same overall tone and intent as the original
6. **Vocabulary Variety**: Use diverse vocabulary appropriate for the ${mode} mode
${strength === "heavy" ? "7. **Extensive Changes**: Completely rewrite sentences while preserving meaning\n8. **Fresh Perspective**: Approach the content from a different structural angle" : ""}
${strength === "light" ? "7. **Subtle Changes**: Make minimal but effective modifications\n8. **Structure Similarity**: Maintain similar sentence flow with different words" : ""}

# Quality Standards
Before finalizing, verify:
- ✓ Original meaning is completely preserved
- ✓ No information added or omitted
- ✓ Text flows naturally in ${mode} style
- ✓ Grammar and punctuation are correct
- ✓ Sentence structures are appropriately varied
- ✓ Vocabulary matches the ${mode} mode
${preserveKeywords ? "- ✓ Technical terms and keywords remain unchanged" : ""}
- ✓ Length is similar to original (unless mode is 'shorter' or 'longer')

# Output Format
Provide ONLY the paraphrased text with no explanations, labels, or commentary. Output should be clean and ready to use immediately.

Now paraphrase the text following these instructions precisely.`;
