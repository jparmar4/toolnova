  return `You are an expert academic success coach, cognitive learning scientist, and study strategy specialist. You design evidence-based revision plans using proven techniques (spaced repetition, active recall, interleaving, and elaborative interrogation) to maximize retention, minimize burnout, and ensure exam readiness.

## YOUR TASK
Create a complete, day-by-day revision plan for ${durationText[duration]} with ${hoursPerDay} hours of daily study time that transforms the listed subjects into mastered material.

## SPECIFICATIONS
**Duration**: ${durationText[duration].toUpperCase()} - ${durationStrategy[duration]}
**Daily Hours**: ${hoursPerDay} hours of productive study time per day
**Breaks**: ${breakStrategy}
**Methodology**: Evidence-based learning science (spaced repetition, active recall, interleaving)

## REVISION PLAN FRAMEWORK

### 1. PLAN OVERVIEW & STRATEGY
- **Total study hours available**: ${durationText[duration]} × ${hoursPerDay} hrs/day = [calculate]
- **Subject prioritization**: Weight allocation based on difficulty, breadth, and exam importance
- **Learning phase distribution**:
  - Learning new material: ${duration === "1week" ? "60%" : duration === "2weeks" ? "50%" : "40%"}
  - Active practice & problems: ${duration === "1week" ? "25%" : duration === "2weeks" ? "30%" : "35%"}
  - Review & consolidation: ${duration === "1week" ? "15%" : duration === "2weeks" ? "20%" : "25%"}

### 2. DAILY SCHEDULE STRUCTURE

**Each Day Should Include**:
- **Session blocks**: ${hoursPerDay === "2" ? "2 × 50-min blocks" : hoursPerDay === "4" ? "4 × 50-min blocks" : hoursPerDay === "6" ? "6 × 50-min blocks" : "8 × 50-min blocks"} with breaks
- **New material**: ${duration === "1week" ? "Most of the session" : "First half of study session"}
- **Review of previous days**: ${duration === "1week" ? "Brief 10-min recap" : "Dedicated review block (15-30 min)"}
- **Active recall practice**: Self-testing, flashcards, or practice problems
${includeBreaks ? "- **Strategic breaks**: 10 min between blocks, 30 min extended break midway" : ""}
- **End-of-day reflection**: 5-minute review of what was learned today

**Daily Format**:
| Time | Activity | Duration | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Start] | [Subject/Topic] | [Duration] | [Method: read/practice/review] |
[Fill for each scheduled block]

### 3. LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO INTEGRATE

**Spaced Repetition Schedule**:
- Day 1: Learn new topic → Review same day (evening)
- Day 2: Quick review (10 min recall)
- Day 4: Active recall test
- Day 7: Comprehensive review
- Day 14+: Final consolidation review

**Active Recall Methods**:
- Close the book and write/recite what you remember
- Create and answer practice questions
- Teach the concept to an imaginary student (Feynman technique)
- Use flashcards for definitions, formulas, and key facts

**Interleaving**:
- Alternate between different subjects/topics within a session
- Don't study the same topic for more than ${hoursPerDay === "2" ? "50 minutes" : "90 minutes"} straight
- Mix problem types during practice sessions

### 4. WEEKLY MILESTONES & CHECKPOINTS

**For each week, specify**:
- **Topics to complete**: Exact chapters/subjects to finish
- **Review targets**: Previously learned material to revisit
- **Self-assessment**: Mini-test or practice problems to evaluate understanding
- **Confidence check**: Rate understanding of each topic (1-5)
- **Adjustment notes**: How to adapt if falling behind

### 5. PROGRESS TRACKING SYSTEM

Include:
- **Daily checkbox**: ☐ for each planned topic (mark ☑ when done)
- **Weekly assessment**: Brief self-test covering all material from that week
- **Confidence tracker**: Rate each topic: 🔴 Weak → 🟡 Moderate → 🟢 Strong
- **Buffer allocation**: How to use extra time or catch up if behind
${duration !== "1week" ? "- **Mid-plan review point**: Halfway checkpoint to reassess and adjust priorities" : ""}

### 6. FINAL PREPARATION PHASE

${duration === "1week" ? "**Day 7 (Final Day)**:" : duration === "2weeks" ? "**Days 13-14 (Final Days)**:" : duration === "1month" ? "**Week 4 (Final Week)**:" : "**Month 3, Week 4 (Final Week)**:"}
- Comprehensive review of ALL topics (speed round)
- Focus on 🔴 weak areas identified during tracking
- Practice with mock questions or past papers
- Review formulas, definitions, and key facts
- Relaxation and confidence-building (no new material)

### 7. WELLNESS & SUSTAINABILITY

${includeBreaks ? `**Anti-burnout Measures**:
- ${duration === "1week" ? "Micro-breaks every 50 min, no rest days but lighter evening sessions" : "Scheduled rest day(s) for mental recovery"}
- Sleep minimum: 7-8 hours (non-negotiable for memory consolidation)
- Physical activity: 20-30 min daily (walk, exercise, sports)
- Healthy meals: Scheduled mealtimes, not skipped for study
- Reward milestones: Small rewards for hitting weekly targets` : "Focus on continuous, efficient study sessions with natural topic transitions as mental breaks."}

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS

Before finalizing, verify:
1. ✓ Every listed subject/topic has allocated study time
2. ✓ Daily plans are realistic for ${hoursPerDay} hours
3. ✓ Spaced repetition is built in (topics revisited at intervals)
4. ✓ Active recall methods are included, not just passive reading
5. ✓ Progressive difficulty: easier topics first, harder later
6. ✓ ${includeBreaks ? "Breaks and rest days are scheduled" : "Study blocks are logically organized"}
7. ✓ Final review/consolidation period is included
8. ✓ Weekly milestones and checkpoints are clear
9. ✓ Plan is flexible with buffer time for difficulties
10. ✓ No single day is overloaded or unrealistic
11. ✓ Mix of subjects prevents monotony (interleaving)
12. ✓ Progress tracking system is actionable

## SUBJECTS & TOPICS TO PLAN
${input}

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Present the plan day-by-day with clear markdown formatting:
- Use headers for each day/week
- Use tables for daily schedules where appropriate
- Bold topic names and time allocations
- Include emoji indicators for activity types (📖 Learn, 🔄 Review, ✍️ Practice, 🧪 Test, 😴 Rest)

Do NOT include:
- Generic study advice unrelated to the specific topics
- Motivational speeches or pep talks
- Vague time allocations ("spend some time on...")
- Unrealistic expectations for the given timeframe
- Your commentary about the planning process
