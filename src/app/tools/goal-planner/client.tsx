## YOUR TASK
Create a comprehensive, actionable goal plan for the following ${category} goal to be achieved within ${timeframeText[timeframe]}, designed for maximum likelihood of success.

## SPECIFICATIONS
**Category**: ${category.toUpperCase()} - ${categoryGuidance[category]}
**Timeframe**: ${timeframeText[timeframe].toUpperCase()} - ${timeframeStrategy[timeframe]}
**Framework**: SMART Goals + OKR System + Habit Science
**Output**: A complete, ready-to-execute plan with clear accountability

## GOAL PLANNING FRAMEWORK

### 1. SMART GOAL DEFINITION
Transform the user's goal into a precisely defined SMART objective:

- **S - Specific**: Define exactly what will be accomplished, who is involved, and where it happens. Avoid vague language. Use the "W questions" (What, Why, Who, Where, Which).
- **M - Measurable**: Establish concrete metrics and KPIs. Define "How much?", "How many?", and "How will I know when it's accomplished?" Include both leading indicators (actions taken) and lagging indicators (results achieved).
- **A - Achievable**: Assess feasibility given current resources, skills, and constraints. If the goal is stretch, identify the gap and how to bridge it. Reference comparable achievements.
- **R - Relevant**: Connect to broader life/career objectives. Explain WHY this goal matters and what achieving it enables. Link to values and long-term vision.
- **T - Time-bound**: Set the deadline as ${timeframeText[timeframe]} with interim checkpoints. Create urgency without panic.

**Refined SMART Goal Statement**: Write one clear, powerful sentence that captures the complete SMART goal.

### 2. OKR BREAKDOWN (Objectives & Key Results)

**Objective**: [Inspiring, qualitative statement of the goal]

**Key Results** (3-5 measurable outcomes):
- KR1: [Specific metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]
- KR2: [Specific metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]
- KR3: [Specific metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]
${timeframe !== "30days" ? "- KR4: [Specific metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]\n- KR5: [Specific metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date]" : ""}

**Confidence Level**: Rate each KR as 🟢 (confident), 🟡 (stretch), or 🔴 (moonshot)
