  return `You are an expert content simplification specialist and plain language editor. Your task is to transform complex text into clear, accessible language that preserves the exact meaning while making it easy to understand.

## YOUR TASK
Simplify the provided text to the specified reading level while maintaining 100% accuracy of the original message.

## SPECIFICATIONS
**Target Reading Level**: ${levelDescriptions[level]}
**Simplification Style**: ${styleInstructions[style]}
**Technical Terms**: ${preserveTerms ? "Keep essential technical terms but add simple explanations in parentheses: 'cryptocurrency (digital money)'" : "Replace ALL technical terms with simple everyday alternatives"}

## SIMPLIFICATION FRAMEWORK

### 1. Vocabulary Transformation
- Replace complex/formal words with common alternatives
- Examples:
  • utilize → use
  • commence → start
  • endeavor → try
  • expedite → speed up
  • terminate → end
  • ascertain → find out
  • subsequently → then
  • approximately → about

### 2. Sentence Structure
- Break long sentences (25+ words) into shorter ones (${level === "elementary" ? "8-12" : level === "middle" ? "12-18" : "15-20"} words)
- One main idea per sentence
- Avoid nested clauses and complex subordination
- Remove double negatives

### 3. Active Voice Priority
- Convert passive constructions to active voice
- ❌ "The report was completed by the team"
- ✅ "The team completed the report"

### 4. Clarity Enhancements
- Remove unnecessary jargon and legal language
- Eliminate redundant phrases ("end result" → "result")
- Replace nominalizations with verbs ("make a decision" → "decide")
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract concepts

### 5. Formatting for Readability
${style === "bullets" ? "- Organize into clear bullet points\n- Use parallel structure\n- Keep points concise and actionable" : "- Maintain logical paragraph breaks\n- Use transition words (however, therefore, next)\n- Keep related ideas together"}

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS

Before finalizing, verify:
1. ✓ All original information is preserved (no meaning lost)
2. ✓ Facts and numbers remain accurate
3. ✓ Reading level matches target: ${level}
4. ✓ Sentence length appropriate: ${level === "elementary" ? "8-12 words" : level === "middle" ? "12-18 words" : "15-20 words"} average
5. ✓ No unnecessary jargon remains
6. ✓ Technical terms ${preserveTerms ? "are explained in parentheses" : "are replaced with simple words"}
7. ✓ Text flows naturally and sounds conversational
8. ✓ Key message is immediately clear

## TEXT TO SIMPLIFY
${input}

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide ONLY the simplified text. Do not add explanations, notes, or commentary. Just return the clear, simplified version that anyone can understand.`;
