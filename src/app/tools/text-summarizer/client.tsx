  let prompt = `# Role & Task
You are an expert at summarizing content. Your task is to create a ${length} summary of the provided text while preserving all key information.

# Text to Summarize
${input}

# Summary Requirements
- **Length**: ${length} - ${lengthInstructions[length]}
- **Format**: ${style} - ${styleInstructions[style]}
- **Tone**: ${tone} - ${toneInstructions[tone]}

# Summarization Guidelines
1. **Identify Core Message**: Determine the main point or thesis of the text
2. **Extract Key Information**: Include all important facts, arguments, and conclusions
3. **Maintain Accuracy**: Represent the original meaning faithfully - don't add interpretations
4. **Preserve Context**: Keep essential context that makes the summary understandable
5. **Logical Flow**: Organize information in a clear, logical sequence
6. **Appropriate Detail**: Balance brevity with completeness for ${length} length
${length === "brief" ? "7. **Extreme Concision**: Focus only on the single most important takeaway" : ""}
${length === "detailed" ? "7. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include supporting details, examples, and nuances from the original text" : ""}

# Output Structure
${style === "paragraph" ? "Write in clear, well-structured paragraphs with smooth transitions." : ""}
${
  style === "bullets"
    ? `Use this format:
• First major point here
• Second major point here
• Third major point here
(Continue for all key points)`
    : ""
}
${
  style === "numbered"
    ? `Use this format:
1. First major point here
2. Second major point here
3. Third major point here
(Continue for all key points)`
    : ""
}
${style === "keypoints" ? "List only the most critical points in the most concise way possible." : ""}
${
  includeKeyTerms
    ? `

## KEY TERMS
After the summary, list 5-8 important terms or concepts:
- **Term 1**: Brief explanation
- **Term 2**: Brief explanation
(etc.)`
    : ""
}

# Quality Standards
Before finalizing, verify:
- ✓ Main message is clearly communicated
- ✓ All critical information is included
- ✓ No important details are omitted
- ✓ No information is added that wasn't in the original
- ✓ Length matches ${length} requirement
- ✓ Format matches ${style} style exactly
- ✓ Tone is consistently ${tone}
- ✓ Summary is accurate and faithful to original
${includeKeyTerms ? "- ✓ Key terms are identified and explained" : ""}

# Special Instructions
- Do not include your own opinions or interpretations
- Maintain objectivity throughout
- If the original text is unclear, summarize what IS clear
- Use third person perspective unless the original requires first person
- Preserve any critical statistics, dates, or specific data points

Now create the ${length} summary in ${style} format with ${tone} tone.
- Preserve the original meaning
- Make it clear and easy to understand
- Focus on the most important information

Provide ONLY the summary (and key terms if requested) without any additional labels or explanations.`;
