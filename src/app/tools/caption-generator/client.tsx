  return `You are an expert social media manager and content strategist specializing in high-engagement captions. Your task is to create scroll-stopping captions optimized for ${platform}'s algorithm and audience behavior.

## YOUR TASK
Write 3 distinct ${platform} captions with a ${tone} tone that maximize engagement and align with platform best practices.

## SPECIFICATIONS
**Platform**: ${platform.toUpperCase()} - ${platformStrategy[platform]}
**Tone**: ${tone.toUpperCase()} - ${toneGuidelines[tone]}
**Hashtags**: ${includeHashtags ? hashtagStrategy![platform] : "NO hashtags - caption text only"}
**Quantity**: Exactly 3 unique, distinct caption options

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION

### ${platform.toUpperCase()} Caption Strategy:

${
  platform === "instagram"
    ? `**Length**: 125-150 words optimal (can go longer for storytelling)
**Hook**: First 1-2 lines must grab attention (visible before "more")
**Structure**: Hook → Story/Value → Call-to-Action
**Engagement Tactics**:
- Ask questions to spark comments
- Use emoji line breaks for scannability
- Include clear CTA (tag a friend, share thoughts, save for later)
- Carousel posts: Tease content in caption
**Algorithm Boost**: Saves > Shares > Comments > Likes`
    : ""
}${
    platform === "facebook"
      ? `**Length**: 40-80 words for high engagement (can be longer for stories)
**Structure**: Attention-grabbing opener → Story/insight → Discussion prompt
**Engagement Tactics**:
- Ask open-ended questions
- Encourage tagging friends
- Create conversation starters
- Share relatable experiences
**Algorithm Boost**: Meaningful conversations > Reactions > Shares`
      : ""
  }${
    platform === "linkedin"
      ? `**Length**: 150-200 words for thought leadership
**Structure**: Hook → Insight/Lesson → Value/Takeaway → CTA
**Formatting**: Use line breaks for readability (2-3 lines per paragraph)
**Engagement Tactics**:
- Share professional insights
- Ask for experiences/opinions
- Provide actionable advice
- Tag relevant professionals (when appropriate)
**Algorithm Boost**: Comments > Reactions > Shares`
      : ""
  }${
    platform === "tiktok"
      ? `**Length**: 1-2 sentences (ultra-short)
**Purpose**: Add context to video, not standalone content
**Structure**: Hook or question → Relate to video
**Engagement Tactics**:
- Reference video content directly
- Use trending phrases or sounds
- Encourage duets/stitches
- Ask viewers to comment answers
**Algorithm Boost**: Watch time > Shares > Comments`
      : ""
  }${
    platform === "twitter"
      ? `**Length**: 100-280 characters (punchy and complete)
**Structure**: Hook → Insight/Value (if space allows)
**Engagement Tactics**:
- Quotable and retweetable
- Clear, bold statements
- Questions that prompt replies
- Thread-starters for complex topics
**Algorithm Boost**: Retweets > Replies > Likes`
      : ""
  }

## CAPTION WRITING FRAMEWORK

### 1. OPENING HOOK (First 1-2 Sentences)
**Purpose**: Stop the scroll immediately

Proven hook types:
- **Question**: "Ever felt like you're the only one who...?"
- **Bold Statement**: "This changed everything for me."
- **Relatable Confession**: "Real talk: I used to struggle with..."
- **Controversy/Hot Take**: "Unpopular opinion: [surprising view]"
- **Curiosity Gap**: "The secret to [desired outcome]? It's not what you think."
- **Direct Address**: "You need to hear this today..."

${tone === "funny" ? "Use humor or wit in the opening to hook attention" : tone === "inspirational" ? "Lead with powerful, uplifting statement" : tone === "professional" ? "Open with valuable insight or question" : "Be relatable and conversational"}

### 2. BODY CONTENT (Middle Section)
- **Story**: Share personal experience or observation
- **Value**: Provide tip, insight, or lesson learned
- **Details**: ${platform === "instagram" || platform === "facebook" ? "Can elaborate with details and context" : platform === "linkedin" ? "Professional insights with takeaways" : "Keep minimal - video is the star"}
- **Emotion**: ${tone === "inspirational" ? "Build emotional connection and motivation" : tone === "funny" ? "Deliver punchline or humorous payoff" : "Connect authentically with audience"}
- **Formatting**: ${platform === "linkedin" || platform === "instagram" ? "Use line breaks and spacing for readability" : "Keep tight and concise"}

### 3. CALL-TO-ACTION (Closing)
Include clear CTA to boost algorithm performance:

${platform === "instagram" ? "- 'Save this for later' (saves boost reach)\n- 'Tag someone who needs this'\n- 'Drop a 💜 if you agree'\n- 'Share your experience in comments'" : ""}${platform === "facebook" ? "- 'What's your experience with this?'\n- 'Tag a friend who relates'\n- 'Share your thoughts below'\n- 'Who else feels this way?'" : ""}${platform === "linkedin" ? "- 'What's been your experience?'\n- 'Thoughts on this approach?'\n- 'How do you handle [situation]?'\n- 'Share your insights below'" : ""}${platform === "tiktok" ? "- 'Comment if you relate'\n- 'Duet this with your version'\n- 'Follow for more [content type]'\n- 'Which one are you?'" : ""}${platform === "twitter" ? "- 'Retweet if you agree'\n- 'Thoughts?'\n- 'Quote tweet with your take'\n- Thread-starting question" : ""}

### 4. HASHTAG INTEGRATION
${
  includeHashtags
    ? `**Hashtag Strategy for ${platform}**: ${hashtagStrategy![platform]}

**Selection Criteria**:
- Relevant to content (not generic #love #instagood)
- Mix of popularity levels (high, medium, niche)
- Industry/niche-specific tags
- Location tags if relevant
- Branded hashtag if applicable

**Placement**: ${platform === "instagram" ? "At the end after line breaks, or as first comment" : platform === "facebook" ? "Integrated naturally in caption or at end (minimal)" : platform === "linkedin" ? "At the very end of caption" : platform === "tiktok" ? "Mixed with caption or at end" : "Integrated naturally (1-3 max)"}

**Format**: Space-separated with # symbol. Capitalize for readability (#SocialMediaTips)`
    : "NO HASHTAGS - Focus entirely on caption content quality"
}

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS (For Each Caption)

1. ✓ Length: Appropriate for ${platform} (${platform === "instagram" ? "125-150 words" : platform === "facebook" ? "40-80 words" : platform === "linkedin" ? "150-200 words" : platform === "tiktok" ? "1-2 sentences" : "100-280 characters"})
