      "All blog articles and tool guides published on ToolNova are written by our editorial team — never copied or spun from other sources. Each piece begins with primary research: reading multiple reputable sources, testing relevant tools hands-on, and synthesising findings into actionable guidance. We use AI writing assistants as a drafting aid only; every article is reviewed, fact-checked, and substantially rewritten by a human editor before publication.",

      "Our contributors are subject-matter specialists: career coaches, certified educators, software engineers, and productivity researchers. Author profiles on each article include their name, role, and area of expertise. When an author makes claims about tools, platforms, or outcomes, those claims are backed by direct testing or cited from authoritative third-party sources. We do not publish articles by anonymous contributors on topics requiring specialist knowledge.",

    title: "Fact-Checking Process",
    description:
      "Before any article is published, a secondary editor verifies all factual claims, statistics, product pricing, and feature descriptions. Statistics are cited with links to the original research. Tool feature descriptions are verified against the tool's official documentation or direct testing. If a fact cannot be verified from at least two independent sources, it is removed or flagged with appropriate caveats.",

    description:
      "Every ToolNova tool is tested by at least two team members across different use-cases before it is made publicly available. We evaluate accuracy, output quality, privacy compliance, and real-world utility. Tools are re-tested after major model updates or user-reported issues. Our testing notes form the basis of the tool description, FAQ, and expert tips shown on each tool page.",

      "The AI landscape changes rapidly. We maintain a content review schedule: core tool pages are reviewed every 90 days; blog articles covering fast-moving topics (AI, job market, software) are reviewed every 6 months. When outdated information is found, the article is updated and the 'Last Updated' date is revised. If a major factual error is discovered, we correct it within 48 hours and add a correction notice at the bottom of the article.",

We investigate all reports within 5 business days. Confirmed errors are corrected promptly and, if significant, noted with a dated correction notice appended to the article. We do not silently delete or rewrite content to cover mistakes.",

        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          ToolNova was founded in 2026 in Singapore with the mission of making professional-grade 
          AI tools accessible to everyone — students, educators, and professionals worldwide — at no cost.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our content team consists of software engineers who build and test the tools, subject-matter 
          specialists who write and review educational content, and a senior editor responsible for 
          maintaining our editorial standards. All contributors are vetted for relevant professional 
          experience before being permitted to publish under their byline.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          We are a bootstrapped, independent publisher. We do not accept paid guest posts, 
          sponsored content disguised as editorial, or product placements without clear disclosure. 
          When we earn advertising revenue through Google AdSense or other networks, this 
          <strong> does not influence editorial decisions</strong> — tool recommendations and 
          article content are determined solely by quality and user value.
